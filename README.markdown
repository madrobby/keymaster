# keymaster.js

Keymaster is a simple (100 LoC or so) micro-library for defining and
dispatching keyboard shortcuts. It has no dependencies.

*It’s a work in progress (e.g. beta), so spare me your nerdrage and instead
contribute! Patches are welcome, but they are not guaranteed to make
it in.*

## Usage

Include `keymaster.min.js` in your web app, by loading it as usual:

```html
<script src="keymaster.min.js"></script>
```

Keymaster has no dependencies and can be used completely standalone.
It should not interfere with any JavaScript libraries or frameworks.

## Defining shortcuts

One global method is exposed, `key` which defines shortcuts when
called directly. 

```javascript
// define short of 'a'
key('a', function(){ alert('you pressed a!') });

// returning false stops the event and prevents default browser events
key('ctrl+r', function(){ alert('stopped reload!'); return false });

// multiple shortcuts that do the same thing
key('⌘+r, ctrl+r', function(){ });
```

The handler method is called with two arguments set, the keydown `event` fired, and
an object containing, among others, the following two properties:

`shortcut`: a string that contains the shortcut used, e.g. `ctrl+r`
`scope`: a string describing the scope (or `all`)

```javascript
key('⌘+r, ctrl+r', function(event, handler){
  console.log(handler.shortcut, handler.scope);
});

// "ctrl+r", "all"
```

## Supported keys

Keymaster understands the following modifiers:
`⇧`, `shift`, `option`, `⌥`, `alt`, `ctrl`, `control`, `command`, and `⌘`.

The following special keys can be used for shortcuts:
`backspace`, `tab`, `clear`, `enter`, `return`, `esc`, `escape`, `space`,
`up`, `down`, `left`, `right`, `home`, `end`, `pageup`, `pagedown`, `del`, `delete`
and `f1` through `f19`.

## Modifier key queries

At any point in time (even in code other than key shortcut handlers),
you can query the `key` object for the state of any keys. This
allows easy implementation of things like shift+click handlers. For example,
`key.shift` is `true` if the shift key is currently pressed.

```javascript
if(key.shift) alert('shift is pressed, OMGZ!');
```

## Other key queries

At any point in time (even in code other than key shortcut handlers),
you can query the `key` object for the state of any key. This
is very helpful for game development using a game loop. For example,
`key.isPressed(77)` is `true` if the M key is currently pressed.

```javascript
if(key.isPressed("M")) alert('M key is pressed, can ya believe it!?');
if(key.isPressed(77)) alert('M key is pressed, can ya believe it!?');
```

You can also get these as an array using...
```javascript
key.getPressedKeyCodes() // returns an array of key codes currently pressed
```


## Scopes

If you want to reuse the same shortcut for seperate areas in your single page app,
Keymaster supports switching between scopes. Use the `key.setScope` method to set scope.

```javascript
// define shortcuts with a scope
key('o, enter', 'issues', function(){ /* do something */ });
key('o, enter', 'files', function(){ /* do something else */ });

// set the scope (only 'all' and 'issues' shortcuts will be honored)
key.setScope('issues'); // default scope is 'all'
```

## Filter key presses 

By default, when an `INPUT`, `SELECT` or `TEXTAREA` element is focused, Keymaster doesn't process any shortcuts.

You can change this by overwriting `key.filter` with a new function. This function is called before
Keymaster processes shortcuts, with the keydown event as argument.

If your function returns false, then the no shortcuts will be processed.

Here's the default implementation for reference:

```javascript
function filter(event){
  var tagName = (event.target || event.srcElement).tagName;
  return !(tagName == 'INPUT' || tagName == 'SELECT' || tagName == 'TEXTAREA');
}
```

If you only want _some_ shortcuts to work while in a input element, you change the scope in the 
key.filter function; however a more robust way to handle this is to use proper
focus and blur event handlers on your input element, and change scopes there as you see fit.

## noConflict mode

You can call ```key.noConflict``` to remove the ```key``` function from global scope and restore whatever ```key``` was defined to before Keymaster was loaded. Calling ```key.noConflict``` will return the Keymaster ```key``` function.

```javascript
var k = key.noConflict();
k('a', function() { /* ... */ });

key()
// --> TypeError: 'undefined' is not a function
```

## Notes

Keymaster should work with any browser that fires `keyup` and `keydown` events,
and is tested with IE (6+), Safari, Firefox and Chrome.

See [http://madrobby.github.com/keymaster/](http://madrobby.github.com/keymaster/) for a live demo.

## CoffeeScript

If you're using CoffeeScript, configuring key shortcuts couldn't be simpler:

```coffeescript
key 'a', -> alert('you pressed a!')

key '⌘+r, ctrl+r', ->
  alert 'stopped reload!'
  off

key 'o, enter', 'issues', ->
  whatevs()

alert 'shift is pressed, OMGZ!' if key.shift
```

## Ender support

Add `keymaster` as a top level method to your [Ender](http://ender.no.de) compilation.

    $ ender add keymaster

Use it:

``` js
$.key('⌘+r', function () {
  alert('reload!')
})
```
